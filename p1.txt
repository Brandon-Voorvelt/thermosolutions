 Our product is manufactured from recycled plastic bottles that have been converted to a fibre also known as PET.
       Making our Thermo-Solutions range very environmentally friendly. In fact, each roll has an average of <b>340 recycled
        plastic bottles</b> and weights an average of <strong>7.5kg per roll</strong>. This not only makes our product denser than our equivalent
         opposition but also allows us to achieve a <b>higher R value</b> as per our SABS ASTM C518. You will also note that our 
         product ranges all conform with the set-out SANS 10400xa with a focus on the environment. 						<br/>
      All our product ranges have been SANS 10177- Part 5, 9 & 10 making up the 428 tests. Which gives us a B/B1/2 rating. 
      The approved SABS testing facility is called Firelab and have been found to meet all
       the requirements with regards to the set-out fire tests.

Thermo-Solutions Roof Insulation uses all types and colours of plastic drinking bottles (P.E.T). By doing this, it allows us to be more 
competitive with regards to <b> pricing </b> while offering the same standard of high quality products and making us more environmentally
 friendly. For this reason, <b> colours may vary </b> from time-to-time.
